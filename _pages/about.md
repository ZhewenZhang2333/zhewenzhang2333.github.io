I am **Zhewen Zhang**, an AI researcher with strong foundations in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
I focus on scalable and robust model development, evaluation, and deployment.

My work spans:
- NLP model optimization and evaluation
- Semantic representation learning
- Instruction tuning for language models  
- Multimodal learning approaches

I am currently preparing applications for **PhD programs in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.  
I aim to contribute to research at the intersection of **deep learning and large-scale language understanding**.
