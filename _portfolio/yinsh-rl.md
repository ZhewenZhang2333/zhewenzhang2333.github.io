## Overview
Implemented a reinforcement learning agent for the **Yinsh** strategy game using **Q-learning**, aiming to outperform heuristic baselines.

## Objective
- Learn a policy that generalizes across board configurations
- Beat heuristic agents reliably

## Method
- Q-learning with game-state encoding
- Reward shaping aligned with winning conditions
- Evaluation against multiple heuristic strategies

## Results
- Achieved **>70% win rate** against heuristic baselines

## My Role
Project lead: planning, implementation, experimentation, final delivery

## Tech Stack
