## Overview
A team project for **Planimation**, a modular and extensible open-source planning framework. We designed a visualization solution for PDDL planning problems with a **Novelty-based** method.

## Goal
- Visualize planning processes and solutions
- Improve interpretability for planning problems

## My Contributions
- Implemented Novelty algorithm components
- Wrote phase reports and organized the final report
- Supported integration and documentation

## Keywords
AI Planning · PDDL · Novelty · Visualization · Team Collaboration
